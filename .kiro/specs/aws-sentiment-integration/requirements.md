# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will integrate AWS's advanced sentiment analysis tools into the existing Reddit data collector system to provide more accurate, scalable, and comprehensive sentiment analysis of compensation-related discussions. The integration will replace the current rule-based sentiment analyzer with AWS Comprehend and optionally Amazon Bedrock for enhanced natural language understanding.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to use AWS Comprehend for sentiment analysis so that I can get more accurate and nuanced sentiment scores for Reddit posts and comments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Reddit post or comment is collected THEN the system SHALL send the text to AWS Comprehend for sentiment analysis
2. WHEN AWS Comprehend returns sentiment results THEN the system SHALL store sentiment score, confidence level, and detected emotions
3. IF the text exceeds AWS Comprehend limits THEN the system SHALL chunk the text appropriately while maintaining context
4. WHEN sentiment analysis fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to the existing rule-based analyzer and log the error

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want configurable AWS service integration so that I can control costs and performance based on data volume and analysis needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN the administrator SHALL be able to enable/disable AWS sentiment analysis
2. WHEN AWS services are enabled THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of AWS region, credentials, and service-specific settings
3. IF AWS costs exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL provide warnings and optional rate limiting
4. WHEN processing large batches THEN the system SHALL support batch processing to optimize API calls and costs

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want enhanced sentiment analysis with emotion detection so that I can understand not just positive/negative sentiment but specific emotions like frustration, satisfaction, or anxiety about compensation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing text THEN the system SHALL detect and store specific emotions (joy, anger, fear, sadness, surprise, disgust)
2. WHEN emotions are detected THEN the system SHALL store confidence scores for each emotion
3. WHEN displaying results THEN the dashboard SHALL show both sentiment and emotion breakdowns
4. IF emotion detection is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue with basic sentiment analysis

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to use Amazon Bedrock for advanced analysis so that I can leverage foundation models for more sophisticated understanding of compensation discussions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN advanced analysis is enabled THEN the system SHALL use Amazon Bedrock with Claude or similar models
2. WHEN using Bedrock THEN the system SHALL extract key themes, concerns, and specific compensation topics
3. WHEN Bedrock analysis completes THEN the system SHALL store structured insights alongside basic sentiment
4. IF Bedrock is unavailable or expensive THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to Comprehend only

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want seamless integration with the existing data pipeline so that AWS sentiment analysis works with current data collection and storage systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating AWS services THEN the existing database schema SHALL be extended to store AWS analysis results
2. WHEN sentiment analysis runs THEN it SHALL integrate with the current checkpoint and progress monitoring systems
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the AWS integration SHALL use the existing error handling and logging framework
4. WHEN data is collected THEN the AWS analysis SHALL be optional and not block data collection if unavailable

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a cost-conscious user, I want intelligent batching and caching so that I can minimize AWS API costs while maintaining analysis quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing multiple texts THEN the system SHALL batch requests to AWS services when possible
2. WHEN identical text is encountered THEN the system SHALL cache and reuse previous analysis results
3. WHEN API rate limits are approached THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent backoff and queuing
4. WHEN costs are tracked THEN the system SHALL provide usage reports and cost estimates
