But then if you incentivize associates to pick 400 units per hour, you run the risk of much higher quality errors, which creates extra work elsewhere, which may or may not nullify the increased productivity.

          "content": "Hi all. I\u2019m on my fourth real day at Amazon (stow), assigned to a station on the 4th floor. At first I loved it! That floor seemed to be inbound stow with only totes, which was perfect.\n\nThen break time happened. I left myself 5 minutes for the bathroom because the bathroom was right in front of the break area. But when I went\u2026toilet was out of order. So I had to choose between being late back to my station or holding it until the next break (not an option). I speed walked to the 3rd floor to find a bathroom but got lost in what felt like an endless maze. By the time I finally found the restroom I was like 5-8 minutes over my break. I was relieved after I went and completely defeated.\n\nOn top of that, my asthma started acting up during the whole thing. I\u2019ve been wheezing all day and if I even speed up slightly I struggle to breathe, so I\u2019ve been trying to pace myself.\n\nI got back to my station out of breath and logged in. Not even two minutes later a guy comes up and asks the number of the station and says, \u201coh you\u2019re at my station?\u201d I told him I\u2019d been late from break and he said, \u201coh that\u2019s why, you have to go back downstairs to get a new station.\u201d I didn\u2019t argue, just sighed and went to get a new station, which was another long walk and made my breathing worse.\n\nMy new station was on the 2nd floor and full of CASES. Heavy, big cases. I immediately said \u201cnope.\u201d Any other day I might\u2019ve tried to push through, but I realized my health matters more than a job and if I tried to muscle through I could have ended up collapsed. So I went home (also like an 8 minute walk just to get to the front of the building) \n\nHas anyone else had bathroom/toilet issues affect break times like this? Are stations always reassigned? \n\n\n TL;DR\n\n4th day stowing at Amazon, nearest toilet out of order, got lost finding another, ended up 5-8 mins late, got reassigned to a heavy case station. I have asthma and couldn\u2019t risk it. ",

Even on FC games it says about 255 but that's because I'm assuming fc games doesn't take into account the break times.\n\nI'm also looking at the % to peers being 91%. Does this mean it's saying that I was below 91 percent of of my peers? If so I find this very hard to believe because I've been about rank 35-40 out of 95 at the end of the day in the building according to FC games. I finish around this rank every day. I sort it by UPH as well. I'm assuming that there is some sort of hidden factor I'm not understanding because it really doesn't make any sense to me. ",

Like the other guy said, fc games isn\u2019t a good measure of rate because it\u2019s only counting your time on station. Units picked/session time. Since it\u2019s saying 255 and you\u2019re actually at a 236, there\u2019s some time that you\u2019re on the clock but not picking. Stand up, the time between signing out and clocking out, bathroom breaks, greeting people on your way to station. Every second clocked in affects your rate. \n\nYou want to stay out of the bottom 5%. I\u2019d suggest, at a minimum, add 15% to that 236 UPH, so ~ 270. At the end of the period, add up the total number of units you picked, and at the end of the day try to be at least 2700. You can start slow and have a killer p2/3, and that\u2019s okay as long as you hit that 2700 for the day. If you want time to talk a little or take a long bathroom break then you need to work a little harder to make up that time lost.\n\nOnce you figure out your flow, you don\u2019t need to worry about watching your numbers, but take it seriously until you do.",

              "content": "According to simple math, (18,405 over 77.93 hours = 236.___) you're only making what the screen says. \n\nWhat FC games pulls info from is not as accurate as just taking the number of hours you're clocked in, and dividing it by the units you moved. FC games only measures the time you're clocked into your station/FC games, so it doesn't count the time you spent walking from the timeclock to standup or your station, or time you logged out for break,  but general rate does count that time. \n\nYou might be able to argue that they didn't subtract your 15 minute breaks from the total, or standup but they'll probably hit back with \"we didn't pull the total for anyone's break, so you're still under guardrail.\" \n\nAlso, the corner widget on your screen only averages your rate over the last few items.  So, if you pick 20 items really fast, then stare at the corner where it says 290 UPH for a few minutes, it'll drop much lower when you start back up, but  almost immediately recover to 290. \n\nGood luck with it.",

I contact hr because I did not use anytime so I was confused on where these hours had gone. I talked to a person over the phone because it was my day off and it was also a weekend .. but the person on the phone proceeds to tell me that I submitted PTO, which I did not bc the date it says I submitted the time , I was physically in the facility for my whole shift.. the person then says that I capped out my PTO accrual. So we get 48hrs? In a calendar year? Would the five months that I worked at my other job be equivalent to the 48hrs? I worked 40hrs a week. ",

I would imagine Amazon wants to spend more manpower/money/time on peak. It's also just harder to teach someone and have them learn as an apprentice during the busiest season of the year.\n\nFrom what I've heard from those who have been through MRA program it's usually just applying everytime something is available and checking often. There's a lot more people who want in the program than there are spots available. One MRA I talked to in the past said he had to apply over a half dozen times before he was able to get in.",

I just talked to HR and asked if I will be converted and they gave me the same cookie cutter answer I have been getting for a while that they convert based on \u201cbusiness needs\u201d. Clearly that isn\u2019t true seeing that hundreds of people are being hired as full time. They still won\u2019t give me a timeline or any information other than they will not convert me now. The advice they gave me was to quit and re apply in a month. As if I can afford to not work for a month and want to take that gamble. Does anyone here have any experience with this? What should I do?

Before that, scattered boxes especially in chiller/freezer (CRG was *packed*), spoiled food, dirty floors, overstuffed bins. We made it work out, but that was nowhere near as easy. Just wish people on my site can clean up for themselves, but \u201cI understand\u201d some don\u2019t or at least for a Fresh FC, even being labor tracked/having good rate throws manners out the wayside.\n\n",

Every single time, no exception, no exaggeration.  I do not think an employee should be held accountable for a flawed system. \n\nOnto the shout-out regarding the point. The point system, however the company wants to sugar coat terminology,  is a part of a disciplinary process.  The shout-out was explaining the point and it tagged two people, myself and another employee.  I was able to click on the other employees name and see their general profile details. I do not think, at least ethically,  the company should be allowing co-workers to see each others disciplinary actions. I personally don't appreciate it. \n\nI have reach out to HR over my concerns and that process is completely in adequate. The associate I spoke with sounded as if they were 100% reading from and sticking to a script like as if I were talking to a call center that deals with mass volume.

It will be done in the next three weeks, but his condition has not improved, and I don\u2019t think he can return to work for at least a few more months.\n\nAfter FMLA, I heard there are options to be on an unpaid leave of absence while keeping health benefits. Would this be possible? We have enough savings to cover a year of living expenses, but I\u2019m worried we might lose health benefits if he simply quits. I am currently in the early stages of starting my own business, so I am unable to get employed elsewhere. Please let me know if you have any suggestions.",

The only caveat being that I did get short term disability, but I was already receiving that when my FMLA ran out. So I got paid and kept my job, but I\u2019m not sure if I only kept my job because it was covered under short term disability. I\u2019d assume they\u2019d be happier to keep you and not pay you on leave.\n\nAnd yes I kept my benefits. I had to pay a lump sum of what I would have paid weekly when I got back, so they took a good chunk of my first paycheck back.",

Lately my body starts mildly hurting pretty early on in my shifts like at the start of my second half but later in the work week I can feel the pain already slightly setting in during the 2nd hour. It\u2019s mainly my upper body / back and at times my feet but that\u2019s understandable because I\u2019m on them the whole day.\n\nI\u2019ve tried getting a new backpack with a strap just incase the weight of that was affecting me. I\u2019ve tried wearing a back brace but haven\u2019t lately because I\u2019ve heard it makes your muscles weaker over time relying on it, I\u2019ve tried just to disassociate while maybe listening to something but my mind physically won\u2019t let me and every minute passes by so slowly. \n\nI work pick, pack, and rebin as of now and get bounced around all three very often during the same day. I get 7-8 hours of sleep to give my body time to recover and heal so I feel like I\u2019m good there but I don\u2019t know what more I can do to try to help my body out. \n\nAny tips or tricks you guys use to smoothly get through your days? Maybe foods that replenish you or tricks you use to keep your body from giving out?",

Pay attention to your body what hurts, when it hurts, and what motions are making it hurt. This is different for everyone so, you need to learn your body. I also switch areas a few times a year. Pick, pack, sort, and areas like same day work your upper body more. Then shipdock is more lower body and core, at least at my fc. As an example before we had the ergo mats on the rebin side, I used to pivot with my feet to turn. With the mats if I do that my knees start to hurt, so I keep my feet straight.

Take them daily once you find comparable supplemnts from Amazon. They are NOT magic pills, but they can mitigate 10-15% of the inflammation. I also HIGHLY recommend FP Insoles. The \"Kingsfoam Elite.\" You trim them to fit and throw them into the oven, then you thrown them in the shoes and walk around in them with socks until they cool. They WILL hurt your feet for the first few WEEKS as they PUSH your muscles where they need to go. After that a pair can easily last over a year of concrete floors and the feel great. They are a bit spendy at 50 a pair, but because they last so long they are worth it. Wear the back brace for 2 hours, then take it off for an hour. No ill effects. HYDRATE! It will help carry the supplements through your bloodstream. I often have to take aspirin after my first break. ALSO, upper body/back pain often stems from a overworked set of back muscles from a WEAK abdominal wall. Basically, your trunk is supposed to work together to hold your upper body up, but with weak abs your back does ALL the work. To remedy this, you have to start doing some ab exercises so they can balance out the load.",

We're massively short staffed and leadership expects us to use some imaginary AI magic to make up for it. There are over 200 buildings with robotic systems and we still can't even build a basic end of shift wash tool.\n\nWe add more buildings every year. We add new robots without getting rid of old ones every year. We're building crazy automated buildings in Louisianna. We are building more and more complex systems for more buildings, but we have flat headcount. We just keept getting pushed harder and harder, so it's just going to get worse and worse and worse until something forces a change. I only hope that it's money that forces the change and not somebody getting hurt. My single biggest fear is that something I build hurts somebody because some L8+ wanted to save a few bucks.",

If they don't pay for the cost of a roof it doesn't meet basic humanitarian standards. That's a very poor approach for one of the richest companies in the world not to meet or exceed that standard. \nAnything under 40 should probably be around 30$ hourly minimum based on cost of living standards and due to the physical demands of the position. \nThat's why they are trying to make these jobs obsolete in the next 5 years bc it's basically unacceptable to keep it this way as you could classify some of it as modern slavery as it doesn't meet basic needs in a lot of situations. Unfortunately, the alternative may be worse than the solution. I don't think they want to be responsible \"it's icky\" at this point.",

Get the notification that it\u2019s delivered but there\u2019s no photo. Literally within a minute I was up walking my entire complex, did three laps, and the package is nowhere. \nOf course the refund process was easy enough but that\u2019s not the point. As a customer I\u2019m just disappointed but as an employee this shit drives me insane.\nI don\u2019t see how he\u2019s allowed to mark delivered without a photo. If this becomes the norm then we should probably brace ourselves for having to replace a lot of packages. Dumb little theft tricks spread like wildfire and before too long it\u2019ll start affecting profits and potentially our wages and benefits. Corporate needs to identify this issue and solve it before it\u2019s a problem.",

Some of the people they hire to drive.......just.......aaarrrrgh!\n\nBut the flex drivers are 100 times worse than my shittiest coworkers. \n\nI see them every morning bringing what looks like entire blocks back and just dumping them at the station. I see them when I'm on route, and it just irritates the shit out of me to see how terrible they are..... blocking doors with packages, or leaving them in the yard or at the edge of the porch, in plain view for the porch pirates.\n\nIn their subreddit, they are all proud of the fact that they will literally just leave your package anywhere....like the entrance gate to a community or apartment complex.  Then, if they do have a return, they just take it back when they go do their next block.....whenever that may be. Even if that's several days....leaving that customer hanging, wondering where their package is... then they go online and say \"The Amazon driver stole my package\" I've seen them bragging about keeping extra packages. And the customers then assume we are all thieves stealing their packages. It's fucked up.\n\nThey make the dsp drivers eat a lot of shit from customers because most don't know the difference. They only know it's delivered by amazon.  So we get blamed for their bullshit.\n\nDsp drivers do enough on their own to earn the negative reputation (I know who I work with, I'm not dumb) we don't need the gig workers out there making things even worse for us. \n\nNot to mention the attitude. They have this mindset of \"I'm my own boss, so I do what I want\" and act like they are superior to us when we see them out in the wild. It's really crazy. You should check out their subreddit....it's eye opening!\n\nThen there's the ones I see out there who just drive and have their small children running the packages for them. WTF?\n\nI wish there was more separation between us and them in the customer's eyes, but amazon does nothing to enable that, and it just reflects poorly on everyone \n\nI think Flex is one of the worst things Amazon has done, and it should go away.",

The bathrooms smell like someone detached their ass and just left it in the bathroom stall. Yesterday I went back to pick for just two hours and it was so quiet and chill compared to pack singles. In pack singles you\u2019re boxed in with people on all four sides.. front, back, left, and right. And if you look over, someone\u2019s always staring right at you! The men in AFE are extra thirsty. \n\nThis guy literally asked my name, walked away right after I told him, then circled back an hour later to ask me on a date. Like sir, I don\u2019t even know your name\u2026 Who are you? Why would I be going anywhere with you?!  Do water spiders even exist? Are they actually real, or just some kind of mythical role? Because they are nowhere to be found. Having to run around for boxes, tape, and extra supplies is a headache. And don\u2019t even get me started on refilling those water jugs for the tape dispensers. This is supposed to be easier? Feels like way more work to me.\n\nPick is hands down the best department. You get your own station, and you\u2019re not crammed in with people on all four sides of you. No one bothers you while you\u2019re working. If something goes wrong, you just raise an andon and asked to be coded if necessary. All you need is a pair of gloves to get the job done. And if you\u2019re lucky enough to get a station near the end of the floor by the bathroom and break room, it\u2019s clutch. It\u2019s quiet, and at least at my fc, the bathrooms don\u2019t smell like unwashed a**.",

So I\u2019m at a loss for words and I\u2019m kind of disgusted. On the pick and choose. \n\nEDIT: Honestly what I was asking if your site lowered the flag or not. Sure I could have left out my opinion on the matter but without the reasoning behind it the question seemed baseless. A yes or no answer would have sufficed but this was anything but that. ",

          "content": "Hi everyone, I just wanted to share my experience with the Amazon Fulfillment Center in California.\n\nSo basically, on my second day, after completing training and receiving my scanner, Safety asked me to stop working about an hour before my shift ended. They told me I could only continue if I stopped using my cane, which would have put me at a very high risk of injury, or leave the premises immediately and wait until I had a doctor\u2019s note. HR/Case Manager approved the accommodation.\n\nI have documented nerve damage and had already disclosed my cane use. I cannot safely work without it.\n\nDuring my pre-hire appointment and orientation, I had my cane with me. Everyone saw it. Nobody ever told me I would need a doctor\u2019s note or an approved accommodation to use it on the job. They waited until after I finished training and received my scanner, just for Safety, to suddenly pull me out and say I could not use it.\n\nWhen I explained that I need the cane because of nerve damage, and that I can walk short distances but cannot safely work without it, they still gave me only two options, which were to either work without the cane, risking injury, or to go home on unpaid leave until I get a doctor\u2019s note and HR approves it\n\nHR then told me that since I am a seasonal employee, my only path is to stay home unpaid until approval. There will be no temporary reassignment, no alternative duties, nothing. They even closed my HR ticket after confirming that I was denied access to work.\n\nI am 18, living independently, and now have no hours to cover my bills.\n\nIs this common at Amazon?\n",

No one communicates between departments at Amazon, so when Safety found out that you were present and using a cane, they probably looked like the \u201cbad guy\u201d because they informed you that an accommodation was required\u2026 when up until that point you were under the impression that everything was fine with your cane. \nNot your fault you were given conflicting information, and yes the accommodation process via DLS can be annoying. But it\u2019s not a case of malice, like a \u201cgotcha\u201d moment of waiting until day 2 to tell you this. It was very likely due to lack of communication and people just guessing when they should have verified. They should have taken you immediately on day 1 to talk with Safety and HR to get everything sorted. \nAnd your time should be coded for this under COF (certificate of fitness) by HR to make sure it\u2019s not taking your UPT while you are getting a Dr note.",

There, I gave them my badge, informed them of the situation, and I was told that he was going to contact my manager to have the time coded, and it should be updated within 24 hours.\n\nWill I be good?\n\nQUICK EDIT: I did have partial vacation time covered for the first hour of the shift, and I learned today that apparently that can mess with the coding \u2014 which is why I presume I was told the AM would \u201cfix it\u201d.",

Make sure your doctor does your case well :)\n\nIt depends if you want hours or days. There is an option on the form for both. I would put as much as you think you would need.\n\nFor multiple days off make sure that your doctor puts more than 1 times per week though and when you are approved for multiple days you can actually add batch amount of time off under the option \"Different  Duration and Different Days\"\n\nOr single instance.\n\nThe adding time screen will look like this and you can either put \"Doctor's Appointment\" or \"Other\" as the reason.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ovmu1768unpf1.jpeg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=04c3a23c36e1e19d036323b674f396f6c03968d0",

For me it's hard not to make above the expected rate in pick, while I don't normally make the expected rate in pack but still do well enough to stay out of trouble. \n\nI think for some people it's just hard to stay doing one thing for so long. I'm ADHD and it is hard for me sometimes, but I manage to be on task enough to do well enough that I've never been written up or anything. \n\nI noticed the delivery station I worked at tried to put older people in physically easier jobs where the FC I'm at doesn't manually staff us.

Just make sure you don't smell and don't get in trouble with management and you'll be fine. And please remember that even when you smoke SAFETY IS OF THE MOST IMPORTANT, if you can't smoke and stay safe just don't smoke it's better to be safe and not get hurt then to injure yourself.",

But don't be afraid to ask your neighbor for help, it's ok they are not going to tell you to f-off.\n\nLunch is like any cafeteria. There are groups that chat out loud and gossip. And there are loners that quietly eat their lunch. Almost everyone just sits there and look at their phone and there is loud chatter in the background. Stow department may have isolated groups of lunch tables where you can sit almost by yourself (it depends on the building).\n\nDon't let anxiety bother you. Just go in to work and reap the money.\n\nBe aware that on Day 1 you may be asked to participate in group activities with your hiring party. Then there is the graduation \"ceremony\" at the end.",

About lunch and break, like someone said, you can eat in your car but if that's not an option, you should be able to find your own spot in a table. If you spend all of your break time on your phone, I think most people will leave you alone.\n\n\nTraining might be tricky since everyone is new and grouped up.

Nothing is a problem until the leaders who want to be right make some sort of \u201cwe were right all along\u201d statement after the fact.\n\nI was recently reading about how corporate cutting  middle-manager roles, having more ICs report to higher-ups is saving costs.\n\nAt the same time, FC/SC/XL/DS networks have been implementing more bureaucracy and bottlenecks, largely aimed at a safety push.\n\nAll the while, same nonsense as usual \u2014 bureaucracy protects managers and management from getting permainstafired for incompetence/malfeasance. Or more simply put: They\u2019re allowed to get away with excuses for their mistakes; mistakes that would get an AA fired.\n\nI\u2019m speaking from experience here, having been written-up by Safety for a non-issue, after repeatedly trying to get that same, supposed \u201cnon-issue\u201d addressed for a month. A month. New equipment, no training. SOP with clear policies managers wouldn\u2019t enforce and made excuses about. Then I get written up (silence him). Then the new equipment gets appropriate signage and training rolls-out. Only after making me a scapegoat. \n\nBut if I point out a member of ASC is ghosting carts and generally not safety conscious, I\u2019m told to stop complaining. \n\nStuff like this is why people say \u201cSafety\u201d at Amazon is a joke. It\u2019s entirely subjective to the whims of management who are protected from their own bad decisions.",

I originally came from a sort center and it was so much better than this. I regret leaving there lol. I don\u2019t know how anyone can work here for 40 hours a week. 10 minutes at Amazon feels like a whole hour and a hour feels like a whole shift. Every day I am there I\u2019m constantly having a mental battle. You run out of things to think about and then your mind goes numb \ud83d\ude02. Time does not move here. We are literally treated like robots. Break is only 15 minutes but it takes like 5 minutes to walk from your work station to the break room. If you need to go to the bathroom you better make sure your rate is good because when you come back you will have to play catch up. \n\nI hope you all find a way out from this job and find something better because this cannot be life \ud83d\ude02. This job will never get any better. There will always be people that need to work out there and Amazon will never be short of workers. Realistically work is work and every job sucks but this job has to be one of the most mind numbing jobs in the world. Invest in yourselves and one day you guys will get out of this hell hole. Good luck to everyone. ",

I feel like anyone can do it if they just pay attention and know how to talk to people and understand how to do basic calculations to make sure everything adds up while doing a wash at EOD. Critical thinking comes into play as well, but with the right amount time and effort, literally anyone with some common sense can do it if they\u2019re trying to promote. I thought I would come in putting my knowledge of what I\u2019ve learned in school to good use, and it has been useful on some occasions. But textbook knowledge and on the job knowledge are totally different. This is probably the easiest job I\u2019ve had so far in my (rather short) career since graduating.

He's the brains and I'm the one who executes the project. \n\nI do agree they have put to much focus on college hires and it's costing them their top talent from the L3 perspective. Most L3's are just leaving for other companies because they are stalling and sick of training an early 20's college hire with next to 0 experience. \n\nI'm dealing with a college hire right now as my new AM. He has openly told me he does not think the job is for them. They are terrified of coaching AA's. They can not say no when AA's ask to go home.

Out of the 4, I would say if you would like an easy job, go to Walmart, you'll spend more time chatting up pretty tings more than working. Aldi will always be the easiest in terms of the job but you'll always be understaffed, having an incompetent coworker will screw you more than the job being tough. Amazon is where you go for insane benefits, they'll offer you all you would want, they'll even throw the kitchen sink at you, but they will get it back in pound of flesh, it can either be the easiest or the hardest depending on where they put you, if you're a water spider in Stow or pick and have average game, you're in for a fun ride. Do not go to home depot. ",

I was supposed to quarantine for 5 days, but 2 of the days were my regularly unscheduled days. DSL will not accept my doctor's note and they want complete medical documentation, consisting of diagnosis, treatment plan, etc.etc. etc. I had a fever, and was the most sick I've been from Covid, this 3rd time. I guess I should have just gone to work anyway, since they won't excuse my time? If a medical doctor determines you should not go to work, I don't feel they should have to prove it with mountains of paperwork when they have sick patients to see!!!",

I certainly do. Its all about how you handle it though. This guy played with fire for too long. Over the course of 7 to 8 months he slowly pushed the line further and further. Anytime id come out of my trailers, there he is, talkin with her. It got to the point where i would crack myself up from guessing when i would see it and be right. Sometimes it would be him on his RC trailing her while shes attempting to scan/pick.\n\nUntil one day i just noticed it stopped. Dude would ride right past her. Of course i got the tea from her. Said one day he like snatched something out of her hand, trying to be funny, she didnt react the way he wanted and both got upset with eachother. He spent the next week puppy dogging (literal crying) , then when that didnt work, the week after was shit talking. \n\nShe transfered to a different department, though that wasnt the only reason. \n\nIt happens if you dont check yourself. If i were to guess I think this guy was even surprised at the outcome. He never took a step back to observe the progression of his behavior. Him \"flirtatiously\" snatching papers out of her hand, her initial reaction of confusion/anger, met with his confusion/anger was an important inevitable energetic exchange for that reality check.\n\nBut who knows, maybe his marriage is already in the shitter. Ive only spoken to him a handful of times and was hired on alongside the girl.",
